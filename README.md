# FileHandle Java Application

A simple Java console application that provides basic file handling operations such as writing, reading, appending, and modifying file content using the standard `java.io` and `java.nio.file` libraries.

## Features

- ✅ Write content to a file
- ✅ Read content from a file
- ✅ Append content to an existing file
- ✅ Modify file content by replacing specific words
- ✅ Simple menu-based interface in the terminal

## How It Works

The program prompts the user to input a file path and then provides a menu to perform operations on that file. It uses:
- `BufferedWriter` and `FileWriter` for writing/appending
- `BufferedReader` and `FileReader` for reading
- `Files.readAllBytes()` and `Files.write()` for content modification

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
- A terminal or IDE to compile and run the Java file
