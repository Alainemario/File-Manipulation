FileHandle Java GUI Application

A simple Java Swing-based GUI application for performing basic file handling operations. This project provides an easy-to-use interface to open, read, write, and modify file content without relying on a console menu.

âœ¨ Features

âœ… Open File â€“ Select a file using a file chooser dialog

âœ… Write to File â€“ Overwrite file content with the editor text

âœ… Read File â€“ Load file content into the text editor

âœ… Modify Content â€“ Replace specific words in the file

âœ… Exit â€“ Close the application safely

ðŸ›  How It Works

The application uses a Swing GUI (JFrame, JButton, JTextArea) to interact with the user.

A JTextArea allows typing or viewing file content.

File operations are handled through a separate FileOperations utility class.

The application is modular, split into:

AppLauncher.java â†’ Main entry point

FileHandleGUI.java â†’ GUI (Swing components)

FileOperations.java â†’ File handling logic

Libraries Used

javax.swing â†’ GUI components

java.io â†’ File read/write operations

java.nio.file â†’ Modify file content

ðŸš€ Prerequisites

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above

Any IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans) or terminal to compile and run
